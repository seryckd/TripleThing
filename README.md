# TripleThing
3-match game in Java

A blatant copy of [TripleTown](http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/) using the excellent free graphics from [Lost Garden](http://lunar.lostgarden.com/labels/free%20game%20graphics.html).

Written in Java just for a bit of fun.

The latest jar can be downloaded and run using

    java -jar lib/TripleThing.jar
